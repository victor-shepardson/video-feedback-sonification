# Video Feedback

`of/feedback3d/*` is an openFrameworks project for running the fragment shader in `of/feedback3d/bin/data/feedback.frag` with feedback from output to input.

it accepts OSC control messages to change shader uniforms and toggle saving frames to disk.

`max/fb-control.maxpat` is a Cycling '74 Max patch which sends OSC messages to the appropriate local port to control feedback3d.

# Sonification

`matlab/*` are MATLAB functions for use with images generated by feedback3d and the [NSL Toolbox](http://www.isr.umd.edu/Labs/NSL/Software.htm)

`matlab/sonify.m` will convert an image sequence generated by feedback3d to an audio wav file and video mp4.
